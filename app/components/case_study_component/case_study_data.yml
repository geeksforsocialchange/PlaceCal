  description:
    - "The Trans Dimension is an online community hub connecting trans communities in London. It collates news, events and services by and for trans people, and is build using PlaceCal."
    - "The Trans Dimension is run by Geeks for Social Change in partnership with Gendered Intelligence with support from the Comic Relief Tech for Good programme. At this stage, the Trans Dimension is focussed on London-based events listings only, however we do plan to expand to cover more areas across the UK."
