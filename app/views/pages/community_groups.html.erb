        <p>Community partnerships, social prescribers and neighbourhood teams in our pilot areas have been able to collaborate quickly and easily, enabling an unprecedented level of coordination.</p>
        <p>The time and money savings from PlaceCal mean we’ve been able to focus on organising collaborative community festivals across multiple venues rather than simply struggling to find out what’s on.</p>

        <p>Residents in Hulme have access to a constantly updated, high quality and trusted community resource with access to dozens of groups and over 200 events a week. The city council and housing associations struggle to even publish 10.</p>
        <p>This tackles social isolation and loneliness at the root level by making it easy for everyone to find something to do. We’ve also used the information to create and deliver physical mailouts using information gathered through PlaceCal — something which would be simply impossible for each group working alone.</p>
