    <h2>Place</h2>
    <p>Partners need to be associated with at least one place. This can be a fixed address if they usually operate from one location, or a service area which can be a Ward or District. Keep this information as specific as possible â€“ limited to where this partner actually runs events rather than the geographical spread of the people they are trying to reach.</p>
