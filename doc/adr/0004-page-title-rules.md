These are constructed in a few pages so just to get it all down in one place for my tests.

- Main PlaceCal home page, default when no title provided: 'PlaceCal | The Community Calendar'
- Main events/partners pages: 'Events & Activities in Your Area | PlaceCal'
- Main event page: 'Event info | PlaceCal'

- Region PlaceCal home page, default when no title provided: 'PlaceCal Region Name'
- Region events/partners pages: 'Events & Activities in Your Area | PlaceCal Region Name'
- Region Event page: 'Event info | PlaceCal Region Name'
